  // Here is how we create a class of a given Dog 
  // the only method that is absolutely needed is 'constructor'
  // which is the method that allows you to instantiate a class 
class Dog{
  constructor(name, breed){
    this.name = name
    this.breed = breed
  }

  bark(){
    console.log(`Bark! my name is ${this.name}`)
  }

  // method to call on the class
  static info(){
    console.log("dogs are great friends")
  }

  // calculating function - becomes an attribute. Called with object.description
  get description(){
    return `${this.name} is a ${this.breed}`
  }

   
  set nicknames(value){
    this.nick = value.trim()
  }
}

const molly = new Dog('molly', 'jack russell')

// Whenever you have a method within a class - you can simply add it 

    // this is a static method - which can only be called on the class Dog directly 
    // Dog.info() - not snickers.info()

    // this is a getter - it is accessed by snickers.description
    // this is not a method - it is just a property you can put on the class 

    // this is a setter to set a value on a given object 

    // and here we can now get the nickname of a given dog
