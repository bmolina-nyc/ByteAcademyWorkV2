// Promises are often used when you are calling a JSON API or making an AJAX call 
// Promise is something that will happen in the future, but not immediately 
// fetch ques up the search and immediately puts in the postsPromise - this is bc JS is asynchronous code 
// https://wesbos.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts
const postsPromise = fetch('https://wesbos.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts')

postsPromise.then(data => data.json())
            .then(json => {console.log(json)})
            .catch(err =>{
              console.log(err)
            })

// Here is an example of why Promises are important


// .then() takes a promise and only runs a given method once the data is fetched 
// we need to make sure that we transform the data into the correct format - in our case, it is a JSON object 
// As good case practices, also add .catch() method in order to catch errors that happen along the way
